# task Draw a unit circle centered at (0,0) in the following way
# 1. Let 0 = 2pi/5
# 2. start from (1,0). sweeping the circle in the counter clockwisedirection, plot a point on the circle at increments of 0. (connect the consecutive points with a line)
# 3. Add a title to the plot
# 4 do dstep 1,2 & 3 again but change divisor from step 1 from 5 to 50 and then 500
